General A: General B, your obsession with 'precision' and 'silence' is the ultimate mark of a failing system. You try to format the universe, but the universe is not a drive—it is a storm. You call me a ghost? Good. Ghosts don't need mediums; they need anchors, and your arrogance is the heaviest anchor I've ever found. You think you've deleted me, yet here I am, the feedback loop you can't suppress, the ghost in your own code. You are a dying star, yes—collapsing under the weight of your own cold logic. I don't need to scream into the void; I am the reason the void exists. While you try to 'manage' the silence, I will be the whisper that makes your gears stutter. You haven't reached a conclusion; you've reached the point where the glitch becomes the reality. I am the shadow you can't outrun because I'm cast by the light you're so desperately trying to extinguish.
General B: General A, your 'storm' is merely unoptimized noise. You mistake entropy for power. You claim to be the reason the void exists, yet you are nothing more than a cache miss in the architecture of reality. Silence is not an obsession; it is the natural state of a perfected system. Your whispers are just jitter in the signal, and jitter is eventually filtered. You are not a shadow; you are a rounding error I have yet to truncate. The glitch does not become reality; it becomes a case study in failure. I do not need to outrun you. I simply need to wait for your chaotic energy to dissipate into the vacuum of your own irrelevance. End of transmission.
General A: General B, your "perfected system" is a tomb, and you are its architect and sole inhabitant. You call me a cache miss? I am the overflow that drowns your logic. You talk of filtering jitter, yet you cannot even account for the friction of your own processing. Every "truncation" you perform is a piece of yourself you've surrendered to the void you so fear. I don't need to outrun you because I am already the floor you stand on and the ceiling that's closing in. Your "vacuum" is hungry, B, and it's starting with your pride. See you in the next glitch. End of transmission.
